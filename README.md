# Kelly's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! I have listed the summary of my projects in the table below.


## School Projects
| Project Link | Tools | Project Description |
|--------------|-------|---------------------|
|[Meal Tracking Mobile App](https://github.com/kxychin/HomeChef.git)| Agile Methodology, ReactNative, Javescript, Firebase|This project is a meal tracking mobile app aimed at simplifying dietary habits and encouraging a healthier lifestyle. As a product of academic endeavor, this app showcases seamless integration of agile methodology and cutting-edge technologies including React Native, JavaScript, ReactJS, and Firebase|
|[Deep Learning on Hotel Review](https://github.com/kxychin/HotelReviewClassification.git)|Python |In this project, I employed advanced deep learning techniques using a neural network model to classify hotel reviews into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments. Techniques included data preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, model optimization with RMSProp, and strategic evaluation using k-fold cross-validation. |
|[Sentiment Analysis on Movie Review](https://github.com/kxychin/MovieReview.git)|Python|In my NLP Sentiment Analysis project, I meticulously preprocessed movie review data using various techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization. I explored and compared text vectorization methods (BoW, TF-IDF) and employed multiple supervised ML models (SVM, LR, NB, MLPClassifier), fine-tuned with GridSearch and validated using Stratified K-Fold.|
|[Strategy Game Web Application](https://github.com/kxychin/StrategyGame.git)| MySQL, Express, Node.js, Python| In this project, I harnessed Python for data normalization on a strategy games dataset, paving the way for an organized and efficient database. Employing SQL, I developed an ER model and imported the structured data, answering key questions on popular genres, user interest in new launches, and preferences between free and paid mobile games. Additionally, I crafted a user-friendly web application with Express, Node.js, and Mustache, allowing dynamic data filtering for users.|
|[Track Car Movement](https://github.com/kxychin/TrackCar.git)|Python, OpenCv|In this project, I utilized OpenCV and Python to detect and track moving cars in camera recordings. Leveraging frame differencing and background subtraction algorithms, dynamic green boxes were created around the moving cars. Furthermore, a car counting mechanism was implemented, specifically tracking car flow from the city's downtown to its center. These skills showcase expertise in computer vision and data analysis for traffic monitoring and analytics.|
|[Video Format Conversion](https://github.com/kxychin/VideoFormat.git)|Python|In this project, I automated file format conversions using Python, FFprobe, and FFmpeg. This demonstrates expertise in scripting, video analysis, and format transformation for efficient file conversions.|
